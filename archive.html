				<h2>Cloudyne Limited</h2>
				<p>Cloudyne was a business that focused on providing small businesses with up-to-date websites with the latest trends. Websites can be expensive and can come as a shock to some people, so they provided them with reasonable prices for the size of their business. Alongside websites, Cloudyne offered domain and hosting with no increase on recurring pricing.</p>

			<div class="sideBack">
				<h2>Helene Simpson Photography</h2>
				<p>Helene Simpson Photography was a client's website that focused on selling photographs of newborns to create memories for the families as their child/children grow up. This was a website that needed to use a lot of imagery to capture the user's gaze and to make a purchase at the end of it.</p>

			<div class="sideBack">
				<h2>Medway Vegan Festivals</h2>
				<p>Medway Vegan Festivals website was meant for a way for people to find out about local festivals and to organise stalls or book tickets to attend them. Production for this website stopped only a few days into the design phase because the client was unsure if they were able to manage the site alongside their other activities. In the images below you will see some low and high-fidelity mixed together.</p>

			<div class="sideBack">
				<h2>Student Project</h2>
				<p>The purpose of this design was to help a student that was studying web design in college who asked me for some help. My aim was to show her how to separate out sections of the site, how colours are important to bring attention and how to get the user to view the site you intended them to.</p>

			<div class="sideBack">
				<h2>Sherwood and Hope</h2>
				<p>Sherwood and Hope was a website that offered funeral services, providing support and information on all stages of a funeral plan. This design was one of my very early ones, which was created on paint.net.</p>

		<div id="pout" class="sideItem project">
			<div class="sideBack">
				<h2>Pout & Sparkle</h2>
				<p>Pout & Sparkle is a website that promotes and sells aesthetics. Since launch, this website has gone through many re-designs and tweaks due to the client having closed and restarted the business, whilst also being indecisive with what they wanted on their website. With this design I wanted to create something that appealed to females and a focus on imagery.</p>

		<div id="sheame" class="sideItem project">
			<div class="sideBack">
				<h2>Shea-Me</h2>
				<p>Shea-Me was my first ever attempt at doing any sort of web design with no prior experience going into it. I used a lot of inspiration from other websites and did an extensive amount of research on what to include in an ecommerce website. The website's purpose is to sell scented shea body butters through their online shop.</p>

		<div id="santa" class="sideItem project">
			<div class="sideBack">
				<h2>Secret Santa</h2>
				<p>The secret santa app was a quick idea that was put across between myself and a friend just to keep our coding skills fresh and to be able to work together again. I took on the challenge of creating the design but since the idea was put across approximately 2 weeks before christmas, there wasn't a lot of time to put into the design. A lot of improvements can be made to this.</p>

				<h2>Style Guide</h2>
				<p>The purpose of this style guide is to allow me to take it with me for all future personal projects and to follow and apply whats in the guide to those projects. This is currently the barebones of the guide and I plan to evolve it overtime from actually turning the components into actual components within figma, making it easier to navigate and more presentable.</p>
